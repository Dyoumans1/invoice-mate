## About

InvoiceMaid is a modern, Django-based invoice management system designed specifically for freelancers and small businesses. I built this application to simplify the invoicing process after struggling with overly complex accounting software that offered far more features than I needed as a freelancer.

This application helps users manage clients, create professional invoices, track payments, and maintain financial records without the steep learning curve of enterprise-level solutions.
